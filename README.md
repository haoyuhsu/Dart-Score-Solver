## Project Intro :dart:

![Pipeline](src/experiment.jpg)

The whole pipelines are broken down into 2 stages:
  * **Region Segmentation**
  * **Dart Location Estimation**
  
## Demo of Project Process :pic:

## Environment and Package required :snake:

* MATLAB R2019b
* vl-feat packages for MATLAB (can be downloaded from [here](https://www.vlfeat.org/download.html))

## Future Works :triangular_flag_on_post:

Makes it practical in real life, such as letting users to build their own dataset and safety system, scanning face to unlock certain devices like PC, mobile phone or a gate.
